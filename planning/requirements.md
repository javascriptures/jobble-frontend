# Technical Requirements Checklist

## Back-End Requirements:

Your back-end must be a

- [x] Node,
- [x] Express, and
- [x] Mongoose API
- [x] with at least 1 non-user models.

No associations are required.

You must have

- [x] Create,
- [x] Read,
- [x] Update, and
- [x] Destroy functionality built throughout the app

(i.e. You don't need full CRUD on every model, just full CRUD throughout your models where it makes sense).

- [x] You must have a test for each of your routes.

## Front-End Requirements:

Your front-end must

- [x] use React and
- [x]leverage the backend API in the above requirements.

You must communicate with the back-end API RESTfully to

- [x] Create,
- [x] Read,
- [x] Update, and
- [x] Destroy resources

(using either [x] `fetch` or [] `axios`).

- You must use either [] CSS Grid or [] Flexbox along with [] media queries to make your app responsive
  across [] mobile, [] tablet, and [] desktop widths.

- You must have at least [] 4 components and at least [] one test for each of your components

## Project Requirements:

- [x] You must include a `planning/` directory that sufficiently demonstrates your
      team's planning process.
- [] Both your front-end and back-end repos have a README that adequately documents the project.
- [] Every team member must have roughly the same number of individual commits in
  the commit history for your app (dividing responsibilities between different
  parts of the app is fine, but every team member must have commits in the
  project).
- [x] Every team must follow a
      [Git Workflow](https://git.generalassemb.ly/seir-129/git-teams)
- [] Every team member must speak for roughly the same amount of time during the
  group [presentation](./presentations.md)

## Deployment Requirements:

- [x] Your back-end/API must be deployed to Heroku and
- [] your front-end must be deployed to
  GitHub pages or [Heroku](https://git.generalassemb.ly/seir-129/project-2/blob/master/project-setup-and-deployment-guide.md).
  Applications that are not deployed will be considered incomplete.
  > We strongly recommend deploying your back-end and front-end separately. This
  > will make it far easier to debug your deployed applications and manage your
  > deployments.

## Final Application

Your project is due on the last day of Project Week (the exact date and time are in your
course calendar).

[] Create an issue on this repo containing:

- [] A link to your deployed application
- [] A link to your Project 3 Github repositories (Do not fork this repo)

The repository for your backend API should include:

- [] A working JSON API (built by your team) built using Express and Mongoose that
  meets the technical requirements above.
- [] Frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project.
- [] A `readme.md` file in the root of your repo that follows
  [good standards of documentation](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-lessons/documentation-markdown)
  (i.e. explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, features,
  installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.)
- [] A `planning/` directory in the root of your repo containing a diagram mapping
  out your project domain. You are welcome to include other planning documents
  (e.g., wireframes, user stories).
- [] A link to your hosted, working API in the URL section of your Github repo:

The repository for the frontend of your application should include:

- [] A working frontend application (built by your team) built with React and React
  Router that meets the technical requirements above.
- [] Frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project.
- [] A `readme.md` file in the root of your repo that follows
  [good standards of documentation](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-lessons/documentation-markdown)
  (i.e. explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, features,
  installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.)
- [] A `planning/` directory in the root of your repo containing a diagram mapping
  out your project domain. You are welcome to include other planning documents
  (e.g., wireframes, user stories).
- [] A link to your hosted, working application in the URL section of your Github
  repo:
